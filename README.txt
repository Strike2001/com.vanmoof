This app connects to your Vanmoof bike with Bluetooth.
For the moment this app only works for Vanmoof Electrified S bikes. (2016 and 2017)
It doesn't support newer bikes (Smartbike, S2,S3,S5)

- Before adding the bike, add your login and password to the app's settings and RESTART the app.
- In the device settings, you can change the polling frequency (in min), note: the more often you poll, the quicker your battery will drain.
- Vanmoof S bikes can only connect to 1 BLE device at the time! (or your phone or homey)
- The general alarm capability marks when your bike cannot be found.
